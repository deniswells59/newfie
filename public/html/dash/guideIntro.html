  <h2 class="center">What's a Guide?</h2>
  <p class="col s8 offset-s2 center">
    A Guide tours guests and helps ensure they enjoy their time, wherever they
    are. A guide should specialize in activities that they also enjoy, and share an
    experience with others.

  <h4 class="col s12">What You're Willing to Do</h4>
  <h5 class="col s12">Pick Locations</h5>
  <p class="col s12">Pick an area you know well. Somewhere you've been before or (even better)
    where you live. This is the place you're offering to escort people who probably
    don't know what's good </p>
  <h5 class="col s12">Choose Your Expertise</h5>
  <p class="col s12">Decide on one or two interests that you can excel at. Do you
    know the best places to eat? Or maybe the best clubs that stay open late? Whatever
    you know, travelers will see the value in it.
  </p>
  <h5 class="col s12">Plan the trip</h5>
  <p class="col s12">Just know what the hell you're doing! Have an itinerary or
    wing it. As long as the guest knows what's what.

  <h2 class="center heading">What's a Guide?</h2>
  <p class="col s8 offset-s2 center">
    A Guide tours guests and helps ensure they enjoy their time, wherever they
    are. A guide should specialize in activities that they also enjoy, and share an
    experience with others.

  <h4 class="col s12 heading">What You Can Do</h4>
  <h5 class="col s12">Pick Locations</h5>
  <p class="col s12">Pick an area you know well. Somewhere you've been before or (even better)
    where you live. This is the place you're offering to escort people who probably
    don't know what's good </p>
  <h5 class="col s12">Plan the trip</h5>
  <p class="col s12">Just know what you're doing! Have an itinerary or
    just wing it. As long as the guest knows what the deal is.
  </p>
  <h5 class="col s12">Recommend an AirBnB</h5>
  <p class="col s12">Throw in a place your you think your companion will enjoy.
    You can even link to your own place and make things easy for you and your guest.
